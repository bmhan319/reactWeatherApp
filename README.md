Summary:
This is my attempt at making a Weather App using React without following along with a tutorial.
I've addressed all the bugs I've come across but will keep updating as I come across more.

Future Feature Ideas: 
1)  Adding a different day/night skin for each country...maybe or maybe not...there's a lot of countries in this world.
2)  A multicity display setup like a slideshow?
